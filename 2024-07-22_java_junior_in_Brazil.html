The Role

Você desenvolverá experiências de usuário envolventes de forma iterativa, usando engenharia de software moderna com foco na experiência e na facilidade de manutenção.

Diferente de muitas empresas, você não estará fazendo apenas aplicações "CRUD", você estará resolvendo problemas de software e arquitetura (computação sincronizada e assíncrona, motores de cálculo, parser de linguagem etc...).

Portanto, mesmo que você não “marque todas as caixas”, mas pense que teria sucesso nessa função, gostaríamos muito de saber mais sobre você.

Requisitos
- Auto motivado e tomador de iniciativa.
- Você entende muito bem o design do sistema (do zero à implementação ao devops).
- Você sabe como implantar seu próprio software na nuvem;
- Ter pelo menos 2 anos de experiência trabalhando com Backend;
- Você tem experiência em definir arquitetura e código de fácil manutenção;
- Você adora testar e melhorar o código por meio de pipelines de CI/CD e testes unitários, de integração e de ponta a ponta;
- Possui experiência trabalhando em equipes multifuncionais, utilizando frameworks ágeis;

O que você fará:
- Trabalhar em uma equipe multifuncional com outros desenvolvedores e cofundadores;
- Ajude-nos a iterar rapidamente e aprender sobre nossos clientes planejando, construindo, testando e lançando recursos;
- Colaborar com engenheiros para melhorar continuamente nossa base de código, experiência do usuário e processos;
- Trabalhar em conjunto com outros membros da equipe através de programação mob/pair e revisões de código;
- Contribuir para o produto conversando com os clientes e compartilhando ideias sobre como facilitar a vida dos clientes
